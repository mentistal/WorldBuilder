		<h1>Text World Theory</h1>
		<p>Text World Theory is a model of discourse processing developed originally by Werth (1999) to account for the cognitive processes involved in meaning-making through language. The theory holds that when people engage in communication we create text-worlds, mental constructs used to conceptualize and understand discourse. Researchers working in the fields of Cognitive Stylistics and Discourse Analysis use Text World Theory to describe the mental representations created by a text and its users. In order to aid their analysis, text-world theorists draw diagrams of the discourse structure, originally in the form of simple 2-Dimensional illustrations (e.g. Werth 1999; Gavins 2007). However, more recently, <a href="http://vue.tufts.edu/index.cfm" target="_blank">Visual Understanding Environment</a> software has been adopted to create text-world diagrams that better depict the multi-dimensional and dynamic aspects of discourse processing (Lugea 2016). Worldbuilder represents the next stage of text-world diagramming, offering analysts a platform to upload, annotate and visualise text-worlds, allowing for qualitative and quantitative discourse analyses. </p>
		<p>We hope that text-world researchers can use this resource to gain insight into their language data and to continue to develop Text World Theory as a powerful analytical model. With ever-widening applications, the framework is improving in efficacy. While most of Werthâ€™s original work on Text World Theory focused on the analysis of literary examples, Gavins (2007) demonstrates its potential for the analysis of a wide variety of text-types beyond literature, including lonely hearts ads, instruction manuals, conversations and audio-guides. Gavins and Simpson (2015) use Text World Theory to investigate how an alleged racist comment from the footballer John Terry was discursively constructed in both the media and in the court case hearing. Their article demonstrates the value of Text World Theory as a mechanism for understanding both a complex case and the complex language data at the heart of it. The researchers behind Worldbuilder have used data from the Meredith Kercher murder case to test and develop the platform, extending the possibilities for Text World Theory to be used in forensic applications.</p>
